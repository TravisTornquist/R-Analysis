## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
When running a linear regression model on the data from MechaCar_mpg.csv there are a number of interesting take-aways.

Two variables provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. vehicle length has a p value of 2.60e-12, and ground clearence has a p value of 5.21e-08. The p-value of the linear regression as a whole is 5.35e-11.

Given that our level of significance is 0.05, our p-vaoue for the model is significantly lower. Therefore the regression does not have a slope of zero.

The linear regression has an R-squared value of 0.7149, so the model has an efficiency of 70%. It is an effective predictor of mpg.
